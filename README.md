# How to Run a REST Fest

[REST Fest](http://restfest.org/) is a collaborative unconference founded in 2010 by [Mike Amundsen](http://amundsen.com/) and [Benjamin Young](http://bigbluehat.com/ "aka BigBlueHat").

## About this book

We've been discussing how to scale REST Fest since before we started it. Over the years many attendees have reached out interested in starting a REST Fest in their part of the world. This book, we hope, will help anyone understand what a REST Fest is, where it came from, and ultimately how to run a REST Fest (or anything similar to one).

### Contributing

Like REST Fest, this book is built from the folks who choose to work on it. If that group includes you, here's the technological lay of the land.

The book itself is "published" (served) by [GitBook](http://gitbook.com) which provides the lovely layout, full text search, and output to EPUB/PDF/etc.

The code is synced between our [GitBook repository](https://www.gitbook.com/book/rest-fest/how-to-run-a-rest-fest/details) and a similarly named [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RESTFest/how-to-run-a-rest-fest/).

Why two places? GitBook's team system is focused on small teams of actual writers (limit is 5 folks for a single organization). REST Fest, though, adds each years attendees to its list of collaborators on GitHub. Given that our hope is for this wide range of collaborators to contribute, it seems syncing with GitHub should provide the familiar "Pull Request" based process for those casually interested in contributing.
